# Python Tic Tac Toe

 This is an simple python Tic tac toe game


USAGE:


       I created this game based of the simple classic Tic tac toe game, but on i also added some new features to it



WHAT I LEARNED:


       1. By developing this game i learned a lot about python and about the pygame module in python.
       
       2. This project improved my python skills quite a lot and i use this experience to build more projects.

       3. This is one of my project that i loved most, bulding this game and figuring out the logics was so
	  much cool, i realy enjoyed it.

       4. while building this game i got so many unique ideas for future use.
